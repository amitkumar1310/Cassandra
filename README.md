# Cassandra
# The dataset used heare in this project are taken from Cassandra problem statement 2
# This is Machine learning/Datascience based project
# For the data preprocessing various methods including one hot encoding for categorical values,also the NA values are taken care 
# Used datetime conversion for different date related columns
# Applied features engineering for some columns which were interrelated or some kind of relation ship was found 
# deleted the unnecessary columns and also deleted some columns after one hot encoding to avoid dummy variable trap
# After preprocessing  splitted the data in train test
# after that applied the various model to get maximum accuracy to predict the actual time
